# CRien
C headers for different things  
doesn't support C++ for the moment maybe in the future.

### How to use
You just have to **download** the raw header you want and **include** it in C.

This is inspired by [Nothings stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb).  
It is not related to stb in any way,  
I just wanted to do a similar project by myself.  
This is a personnal-usage project in which I didn't see any inconveninence to make it public   
don't expect perfect nor clean code,  
I can't guarantee to keep this maintained.
