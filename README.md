# CRien
C headers for different things  
doesn't support C++ for the moment maybe in the future.

### How to use
You just have to **download** the raw header you want and **include** it in C.

Example:
You want to use the stack I implemented.  
In a terminal:  
```
cd PROJECT_PATH
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdrtH/CRien/main/cr_stack.h
```  
then in the begining of your C file:
```
#include "./cr_stack.h"
```
and your good to go !


This is inspired by [Nothings stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb).  
It is not related to stb in any way,  
I just wanted to do a similar project by myself.  
This is a personnal-usage project in which I didn't see any inconvenience to make it public,   
Don't expect perfect nor clean code,  
I can't guarantee to keep this maintained.
